#+TITLE: never-comment README

* ABOUT

Often C programmers type blocks of code between =#if 0= and =#endif=.
This code will never be compiler. Therefore some IDE's display this code
as comment. With this module, emacs will also do this.

* INSTALLATION

Just put this file in your emacs =load-path= and type =(require 'never-comment)=
somewhere in your =.emacs= init file.

* DISCLAIMER
The code is actually written by Scott Frazer on [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/4554658/89376][stackoverflow.com]]. [[https://github.com/To1ne][I]] took the liberty
to put the code on github.com.
